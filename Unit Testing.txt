who is responsible for unit testing ?
developer is responsible for unit testing.

To Test the microservices we have different types of testing framework is available.
Junit:junit provides fundamentals of writing unit test cases.
Mockito:Mocking external dependency(has dependency)
MockMVC:Calling Controller method without starting spring boot server.
RestTemplate:Integrating Testing(communication between microservices).
H2 db:creating mock db(use )
suppose if db is not available and i don't like to work on realtime database which is use in production then create a mock db and test database separately.


in microservices we already tested using the postman then what is need of unit testing?
we can test fully but can't test individually 
like controller,service,repository
hence we are using unit testing
